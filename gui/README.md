## GUI

You will need PureData's **pd-extended** to run this GUI.

Once you have **pd-extended**, start it up, go to `File > Open...` and select the file in this directory named `main.pd`. Ignore all the other files, they are only there to serve as support for `main.pd`.

The GUI will attempt to make a network connection upon start up, so that it can send commands to. Look in PD's main message window and make sure that this connection was successful.
